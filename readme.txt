PT Sign Ups is the latest, free, flexible, and greatest volunteer sign up and management tool.

== Description ==
[PT Sign Ups](https://www.mjssoftware.com) is the latest and greatest volunteer sign up and management tool available on WordPress.

Our core platform is free, flexible, and driven by its users. The freedom of open-source means you retain full ownership of your sign up’s content and data forever.

Whether you’re organizing a pot luck, committee, event, or team snack schedule, use PT Sign Ups for a volunteer management system that blends simplicity with detail.

- Create and **manage unlimited volunteers**
- **Set publishing dates** when needed
- Create **unlimited tasks or slots**
- Build **recurring sign ups** that happen throughout the week, month or year
- **Manage volunteers**
- **Track volunteer time** or points
- Collect **custom field** information
- Force **‘Agree to Terms’** for your volunteers
- **Unlimited administrators**
- Send receipts and **reminders**
- **Limit volunteers** per task or slot

Built-in tools and a simple-to-use interface help you efficiently manage all your volunteer sign ups with ease. Transitioning the management of sign ups and volunteers from user to user is as easy as adding the new person as an administrator of the sign up or plugin – allowing users to easily pass their work on to the next volunteer.

- **Customize the look and feel of your sign up with color branding and font management.** Match it to your website look and feel for a truly blended experience.
- **Find out who your best volunteers** are with reports that can be run by hours worked, points earned, number of slots assigned, or signups attended. 
- **Find the status of your sign ups quickly** to see where more help is needed or what has been filled.
- Publish your sign ups to allow interested parties to see what is available **without needing to hunt down your next volunteer.**
